# Arch 2022

After switching to Mac for two years almost (my current company gave me a MBP. I can now confirm that I hate it.), I am now back to Linux.
I just bought a system76 Lemur Pro, and will cover my setup here.

## Prep

Follow the pre-installation in the [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) up until "partition the disks", because we deviate there.

## Disk Setup

This is inspired by the following two videos, please support the guy who makes those, he helped me a lot: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm_fuBeaOqE) [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm_fuBeaOqE)
